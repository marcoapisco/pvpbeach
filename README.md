## PvPBeach

A Staff bot made for [PvPBeach](https://pvpbeach.com).

### Project details
This bot was made in [Discord Bot Maker](https://store.steampowered.com/app/682130/Discord_Bot_Maker/), a 10$ Steam game which allows you to visually edit programs. It uses the default actions from the game, so you don't have to import external mods.

I'm not giving you a tutorial on how to import the files into the game, learn it yourself.

### Copyright
This "code" which is more like data is not licensed at all. Feel free to do whatever you want.

There isn't any person or company who will convince me to take down code I wasn't paid to make. I believe most software should be open source.
